# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

> **A Python implementation of core Machine Learning algorithms using only `NumPy`.**
> This repository aims to demystify the "Black Box" of ML libraries by implementing the underlying mathematics from the ground up.

## 📚 Overview
The goal of this project is to implement fundamental ML algorithms without relying on high-level frameworks like `scikit-learn`. Each implementation is structured as a Python Class and focuses on vectorization, linear algebra, and statistical intuition.

This is an educational project designed to demonstrate a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations of Data Science.
